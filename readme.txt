Identify Dependencies
The app.py file and the overall project use the following libraries and packages:

Flask: The web framework used to build the application.
Used for routing (app.route), handling requests (request), and serving templates (send_from_directory).
docx (python-docx): For reading .docx files in the extract_text_from_docx function.
pandas: For reading Excel files (extract_text_from_excel).
faiss-cpu: For similarity search using the FAISS index (IndexFlatL2).
numpy: For numerical operations, especially with embeddings (np.vstack, np.array).
json: For reading and writing JSON files (e.g., knowledge_base.json, prompt.json, metrics.json). This is part of Python's standard library, so it doesn't need to be listed in requirements.txt.
huggingface_hub: For interacting with the Hugging Face Inference API (InferenceClient).
requests: For making HTTP requests to the OCR Space API (requests.post).
base64: For encoding PDF files to base64 format. This is part of Python's standard library.
logging: For logging debug information. This is part of Python's standard library.
transformers: For loading the local embedding model (AutoTokenizer, AutoModel).
torch: Required by the transformers library for model inference (torch.no_grad, torch.cuda.empty_cache).
PyMuPDF (fitz): For local PDF text extraction (extract_text_from_pdf_local).
uuid: For generating unique document IDs (uuid4). This is part of Python's standard library.


pip install -r requirements.txt


pip install flask google-generativeai openai







✅ Features Included:
🎙️ Speech-to-Text using OpenAI Whisper API


🧠 Voice command interpretation via Gemini (Google LLM)


🔊 Text-to-Speech using OpenAI TTS (Chirp)


🖼️ Local HTML/JS interface to show images and control actions


🛎 Concierge request logging (saved to requests.json)


🏨 Service screen for hotel requests



🧪 Next Steps:
Replace keys in app.py:

 python
CopyEdit
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY")
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"


Run the backend:

 bash
CopyEdit
pip install flask google-generativeai openai
python app.py


Open frontend/index.html in browser (double-click or open via localhost)



Let me know if you’d like:
Docker support


Real-time microphone streaming


Upload to Replit or Render for demo


Ready to assist you further! 

Here's a step-by-step guide to get your Gemini API key (from Google) and OpenAI API key (for Chirp/Whisper TTS & STT):

🔑 1. Get OpenAI API Key (for STT/TTS using Chirp)
✅ Steps:
Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys


Log in with your OpenAI account


Click "Create new secret key"


Copy the key (starts with sk-...) and store it securely


🧠 What it's used for:
Speech-to-Text via Whisper (/v1/audio/transcriptions)


Text-to-Speech via Chirp (/v1/audio/speech)



🔑 2. Get Google Gemini API Key (for Gemini LLM)
✅ Steps:
Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey


Sign in with your Google account


Click "Create API key"


Copy the generated key (looks like a long alphanumeric string)


🧠 What it's used for:
Conversational logic via Gemini Pro in your Flask app



🔧 Where to Paste in Your Code
In app.py, update these lines:
python
CopyEdit
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY")
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

Replace with:
python
CopyEdit
genai.configure(api_key="AIzaSy...")  # Gemini key
openai.api_key = "sk-..."             # OpenAI key


🔐 Security Tips
Never expose keys in frontend (HTML/JS)


Use .env files or environment variables for production


Regenerate keys if compromised



Let me know once you’ve got your keys — I can help you test your first voice interaction or show how to secure your keys locally.
